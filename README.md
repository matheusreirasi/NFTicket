# Overview
This website was built as a work for my college. Its goal is to sell NFT tickets for indoor soccer of the college.

The front end is made with React and styled with Tailwind. Transition between pages is with React Router DOM and transition animation is with Framer Motion.
I used Hardhat to build the smart contract 

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
node scripts/mint-nft.js
```

## Future improvements

* Insert an auth for user wallet
* Save user wallet to use it after even the page reloads
* Keeping trying to improve page transitions
* Improve NFT transitions and bitcoin transitions
